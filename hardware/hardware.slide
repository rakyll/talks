: Hi, I am JBD. I work on a kernel project at Google that targets embedded systems.
: And today, I am going to be talking about some core packages I will propose to the Go project.
: First things first.
: The title may sound a bit odd the audience. Does anybody know what peripheral means?
: Well, if you are asking this question, you are not alone.

* What? Peripheral? ðŸ¤”

: When I first proposed this idea on golang-dev, there has been various confusing responses.
: Here, Brad Fitzpatrick is like I don't like this or like that
: But what about calling it profiterols?...
: Because they are tasty at least?...
: My answer is going to be like... Nope.

* Peripheral devices

External devices such as input and output devices are peripheral devices.

: Let me give you a bit of background about the peripherals first.
: Peripheral devices are basically external devices.
: It could be anything like a display, or a keyboard or a sensor.
: Any external device that talks to your host computer is basically what my focus is.
: Here I have my Raspberry Pi using an SSD1306 display, that display is a peripheral.

* Peripheral? ðŸ¤”

Why do we need to care about peripheral devices and protocols?

Make Go a better language for hardware projects.

: So, let's keep asking questions.
: Why are we talking about peripheral devices and protocols in the context of Go?
: Because, we want to talk about Go and hardware projects and making Go a better languages in this field.
: Hardware projects are often made of a board and surronding peripherals.
: So, peripherals are highly important for hardware projects.

* Why to include Go into hardware projects?

- Go is efficient, fast and has low memory footprint.
- Out-of-the-box cross compilation.
- A language makes I/O programming fun.
- Static binaries, distribution is easy.
- Cgo is productive if porting C/C++ libs is not an option.

: But why do we care about hardware projects?
: To give you a bit of my personal history, I started using Go in 2012 to write hardware controllers and I had a similar list even back then.
: It only gets better in time though.
: (Go through the list...)

* GPIO

General purpose programmable pins (usually between 0V-5V)

: The next step, I wanna give a bit of context about common peripheral protocols.
: Some of them you might have already know like USB, serial port, etc.
: I will focus on GPIO here. Let's zoom into my Raspberry Pi photo and focus on the pins.
: A board like raspberry pi gives you all these programmable pins.
: You can program the output signal from the user space, and equally can read the values if you program pin to be an input.
: These values are often between 0 and 5 volts but may change depending on the board and its power requirements.

* I2C

Or high-level protocols can be programmed on GPIO pins such as I2C

.image img/i2c.png _ 650

: The other protocol I want to mention is I2c, an example of a higher level serial protocol and it is pretty popular.
: The raspberry pi has an I2c bus. The GPIO pins on the top can be used to communicate with this bus.
: In I2C, there are two main signals. Clock and data.
: By looking at the edges, according to the clock signal, I2c devices can determine the messages.

* Software stack in hardware projects

.image img/layers.png _ 800

: But, as software engineers, we don't have to learn about the signal-level details of these protocols.
: Because there are layers and layers of software that encapsulates them from us.
: In this diagram, I am going to explain you what it takes to communicate with a device from a user program.
: You import an existing high-level protocol library or write one. Gobot and similar libraries are your downstream.
: Those libraries are making system calls according to the functions your hardware abstraction layer provides.
: Note that hardware abstraction layer may differ depending on the operating system and capabilities.
: HAL communicates with the physical pins and it works!

* The current state

- Successful existing solutions (e.g. gobot, hwio, embd, etc).
- Lack of common interface.

: So, it seems like there is already a way to make this work. What are we fixing?
: We know that Go is great when third-party libraries can cooperate, existing libraries cannot.
: We need to address the issue with common core abstractions.
: Second problem is, some libraries are not portable (e.g. works only against devfs).
: I don't want to rewrite the entire program because I want to target a different operating system/platform.
: By creating abstractions addressing these two issues we can fix the fragmentation in the community.

* Why to have common interfaces?

Fix the fragmentation.

Make libraries portable, extendable, composable.

: To recap the goals:
: Fix the fragmentation and make libraries portable, extendable and composable.

* Peripheral I/O for Go

.image img/iopkg.png _ 800

(Current experimentation is at [[https://golang.org/x/exp/io]])

: We started an official package experiment under x/exp/io.
: These is the playground for the core abstractions.
: We currently are working on the GPIO package whereas the I2C and SPI packages are almost mature.
: To give you a bit of context, we follow the sql package's driver model.
: There is a user-land and drivers. Depending on the platform you target, you can change the driver you depend on.

* Why drivers?

.image img/piolayers.png _ 800

: To illustrate where drivers would fit, let's look at the software stack once again.
: The peripheral packages will sit below the domain specific libraries like gobot.
: The driver will be HAL-specific implementation and can be switchable depending on the platform.
: That's how by just passing an argument to the connection, you will be able to port your code to another system.

* Peripheral I/O for Go (cont.)

Open a connection to an i2c device via devfs while keeping the rest of the code portable.

  import "golang.org/x/exp/io/i2c"

  // devfs specific backend
  o := &i2c.Devfs{Dev:"/dev/i2c-1"}

  // portable code...
  device, err := i2c.Open(o, 0x39)
  if err != nil {
      panic(err)
  }
  if err := device.WriteReg(0x04, 0x40, 0x40); err != nil {
      panic(err)
  }

: This is a snippet using the i2c package.
: You can see there are two different sections.
: The first section is the initialization of the driver, the driver works against devfs on linux.
: The second part uses the driver and is entirely portable. All you need is to init a different driver when porting.

* Peripheral I/O for Go (cont.)

Each protocol package contains

- user facing APIs
- driver abstractions
- a set of popular implementations (e.g. devfs, sysfs, firmata)

: To recap,
: Each protocol package will be consisting of user facing APIs, driver abstractions and a set of popular driver implementations.
: We are thinking about and working on devfs and sysfs for Linux, Adrian has been working on a firmata backend.
: So you can program your Arduino-like chips from your laptop and reuse your existing code.

* Summary

Provide a downstream protocol library with core abstractions. Propose an official package. GPIO, SPI, I2C and UART are first.

- Focus on portability.
- Provide extendability, composability, chainability.
- Provide common backends, e.g. devfs, sysfs, firmata.
- Apply the interfaces to the high-level libraries such as Gobot.

Deliver strategies for integration testing.

Deliver end-to-end guides.


* How to contribute?

- GPIO package is under construction, wait for it to be finalized.
- Write code against I2C and SPI and let us know.
- Experiment by writing device drivers, examples at [[https://github.com/goiot/devices]].
- File bugs at [[https://golang.org/issues]].

: The design process is taking a while because we don't want to break the APIs ever.
: GPIO is going to take a while because we want to address two critical issues before we finalize.
: The analog pins (which are hard to achieve on non-real time systems) and handling of interrupts.
: You can consider I2C and SPI to give a try, contribute changes and help the documentation.
: We are trying to write device driver to experiment the interfaces and the implementations, there are under goiot/devices.
: Finally, bugs need to be filed to the Go project's issue tracker. Try, file issues and propose improvements.
